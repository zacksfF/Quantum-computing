## Introduction to Quantum Computing

**Quantum computing** is an emerging field of computing that leverages the principles of quantum mechanics to process information in fundamentally different ways than classical computing. In classical computing, information is processed using bits, which can represent either a 0 or a 1. In contrast, quantum computing uses quantum bits or qubits, which can exist in a superposition of states, enabling the computation of complex problems significantly faster than classical computers for certain tasks.

Quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize industries such as cryptography, optimization, material science, and drug discovery by solving problems that were previously considered infeasible.

## Cirq: Google's Quantum Computing Framework
